# RhinoCompute_Toolkit
BHoM Toolkit with Rhino/Grasshopper objects and functions to compute Grasshopper scripts (locally or via WebService) that can include BHoM functions and objects.


### Forked from [RhinoCompute](https://github.com/mcneel/compute.rhino3d) and heavily adapted for BHoM
Some degree of compatibility with existing RhinoCompute scripts is maintained. Tested with input/outputs specified via named groups, not with Hops. See tests in [Computing_Toolkit](https://github.com/BuroHappoldEngineering/Computing_Toolkit).


#### More info on RhinoCompute

See https://www.rhino3d.com/compute. Compute is built on top of Rhino 7 for Windows and can run anywhere Rhino 7 for Windows can run.

ðŸ›  Start with ["Developing with Rhino Compute"](https://developer.rhino3d.com/guides/compute/development/) to run Compute locally for testing and debugging.

ðŸ“¡ See ["Deploying Rhino Compute"](https://developer.rhino3d.com/guides/compute/deploy/) to setup your own Compute server.
